I think the first step is to fix all of the "errors" caused by changing the API (ie: create valid constructors and function stubs),
and allow the project to compile. 
Then, I want to implement SetContentsOfCell and change my test cases to test that function. Then I will get to work on the file saving and validation 
features of the new API.

Currently I am using updated versions of Formula and DependencyGraph that pass all of the Grading Tests, 
and my original PS4 Solution which was submitted for grading.
