I think the first step is to fix all of the "errors" caused by changing the API (ie: create valid constructors and function stubs),
and allow the project to compile. 
Then, I want to implement SetContentsOfCell and change my test cases to test that function. Then I will get to work on the file saving and validation 
features of the new API.

I Updated my PS4 solution to pass all the grading tests, then merged with my PS5 branch to pull down the changes. I included all the PS4 Grading tests
and changed them to use the new API. Next steps are to write some tests and implement the code around saving the file and loading it.

Currently I am using updated versions of Formula and DependencyGraph that pass all of the Grading Tests, 
and an update PS4 project that passes all the grading tests.
