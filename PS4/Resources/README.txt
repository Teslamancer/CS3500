Hunter Schmidt - 9/16/19
I think I am going to write a private class to represent cells as self-contained "nodes" which can store a text formula and/or a value,
They will also Store a dependencygraph for themselves of their dependees and dependents.

Currently I am using the same versions of PS2 and PS3 that I turned in, and am hoping to update those once grades are released
if modifications are necessary.
